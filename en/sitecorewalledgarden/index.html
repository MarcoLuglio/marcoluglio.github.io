<h1>Sitecore <span>walled garden</span></h1>

<p>
	So, you saw Gartner Digital Experience Platform (DXP) magic quadrant and decided to learn about Content Management Systems.
	Or maybe you are tired of working with Wordpress and wanted to check out the alternatives, maybe one in C#?
	Starting with these platforms can be slow and challenging for a number of reasons.
	Stick around and I will do my best to get you jump started.
	In this article Iâ€™ll talk about Sitecore.

<p>
	In <a rel='external nofollow' href='https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3995917/magic-quadrant-for-digital-experience-platforms'>Gartner Magic Quadrant</a>,
	<a rel='external nofollow' href='https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-64/developing/home.html?lang=en'>Adobe Experience Manager</a> seems to be the current leader, but it is written in Java (no surprise there, given the choice for previous products such as ColdFusion).
	Others being <a rel='external nofollow' href='https://dev.acquia.com/'>Acquia (PHP)</a>, <a rel='external nofollow' href='https://world.episerver.com/'>Episerver (C#)</a> <a rel='external nofollow' href='https://portal.liferay.dev/'>Liferay (Java)</a> and <a rel='external nofollow' href='https://dev.sitecore.net/'>Sitecore (C#)</a> naturally.
	Again, the world seems to be divided between the two usual suspects, with an alternative for developers that frown upon more formal languages.
</p>

<p>
	Now, if you are wondering why not just call it the <abbr>CMS</abbr> magic quadrant and make everyones lifes easier, it used to be called just that.
	And for what developers may care the most, that is probably where we will spend most of our time.
	<strong>But</strong>, as you may already have suspected, developers are not the focus of these platforms.
	In fact, progamming languages are not even mentioned in the homepage os the aforementioned products, and you will only find about them after some digging.
