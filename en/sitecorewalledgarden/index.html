<h1>Sitecore <span>walled garden</span></h1>

<p>
	So, you saw Gartner Digital Experience Platform (DXP) magic quadrant and decided to learn about Content Management Systems.
	Or maybe you are tired of working with Wordpress and wanted to check out the alternatives, maybe one in C#?
	Starting with these platforms can be slow and challenging for a number of reasons.
	Stick around and I will do my best to get you jump started.
	In this article I‚Äôll talk about Sitecore.

<h2 id='magicquadrant'>Languages of Gartner Magic Quadrant</h2>

<p>
	In <a rel='external nofollow' href='https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3995917/magic-quadrant-for-digital-experience-platforms'>Gartner Magic Quadrant</a>,
	<a rel='external nofollow' href='https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-64/developing/home.html?lang=en'>Adobe Experience Manager</a> seems to be the current leader, but it is written in Java (no surprise there, given the choice for previous products such as ColdFusion).
	Others being <a rel='external nofollow' href='https://dev.acquia.com/'>Acquia (PHP)</a>, <a rel='external nofollow' href='https://world.episerver.com/'>Episerver (C#)</a> <a rel='external nofollow' href='https://portal.liferay.dev/'>Liferay (Java)</a> and <a rel='external nofollow' href='https://dev.sitecore.net/'>Sitecore (C#)</a> naturally.
	Again, the world seems to be divided between the two usual suspects, with an alternative for developers that frown upon more formal languages.
</p>

<p>
	Now, if you are wondering why not just call it the <abbr>CMS</abbr> magic quadrant and make everyone‚Äôs lifes easier, it used to be called just that.
	And for what developers may care the most, that is probably where we will spend most of our time.
	<strong>But</strong>, as you may already have suspected, developers are not the focus of these platforms.
	In fact, programming languages are not even mentioned in the homepage of the aforementioned products, and you will only find about them after some digging.
	Marketing folks and copywriters are the main target of these platforms.
</p>

<p>
	For a good while now, brands have expanded way beyond their web sites and email marketing campaign fronts to all sorts of social media and mobile channels and who knows what else in the future.
	We needed a name for that. <abbr>DXP</abbr>.

<h2 id='moviepuns'>Movie puns + why so hard on new devs?</h2>

<p>
	Beam me up Scotty, welcome aboard the Enterprise.
	Enterprise applications world that is, where software trials, distribution and source are heavily guarded and as closed and opaque as possible.
	Because you, humble dev, is not calling the shots here.
	Commercial agreements to buy these platforms have been made by people way above your pay grade.
	Those are the people that need to be convinced by the platforms.
</p>

<p>
	Nevertheless, software requires devs right?
	So what‚Äôs left for us?
	Let‚Äôs sail to <strong>Isla de Muerta</strong> üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è.
	The island that cannot be found, except for those who already know where it is.
	Because while documentation and official training may seem lacking, there are people who went through this and are willing to share knowledge.

<h2 id='setup'>Getting ready</h2>

<p>
	Before you even think on doing anything, you will need a Sitecore license.
	It is what it is.
	If you do not work for a company that already has a deal with Sitecore, you may request a trial which will likely be followed up close by the Sitecore sales team.
</p>

<p>
	Sitecore uses the .Net <strong>Framework,</strong> which is <strong>only available for Windows,</strong> and requires <abbr>IIS</abbr> for hosting.
	Sitecore 10 does have <strong>some parts</strong> written in .Net core, and an official Docker image, but because it is still bound to <abbr>IIS</abbr>, those are fat ass Windows images that take a lot of disk space, and require 32GB of <abbr>RAM</abbr>.
</p>

<p>
	The <strong>Docker + Sitecore 10 path is easier to get started if you have the hardware.</strong>
	As simple as installing <a rel='external nofollow' href='https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop'>Docker Desktop</a> and running <code>init.ps1</code> a command in PowerShell.
	<a href='https://github.com/Sitecore/docker-examples/tree/develop/getting-started'>https://github.com/Sitecore/docker-examples/tree/develop/getting-started</a> and <a href='https://github.com/Sitecore/Helix.Examples/tree/master/examples/helix-basic-aspnetcore'>https://github.com/Sitecore/Helix.Examples/tree/master/examples/helix-basic-aspnetcore</a> are two places where you can clone starting reference projects.
</p>

<p>
	If you do not have 32GB of <abbr>RAM</abbr>, or just want a lighter environment, installing Sitecore on premisses is the way to go. For that you won‚Äôt need anything out of the ordinary:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a rel='external nofollow' href='https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework'>.Net Framework</a> (likely installed already)</li>
	<li><abbr>IIS</abbr> (enable it in Windows features)</li>
	<li><a rel='external nofollow' href='https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads'><abbr>SQL</abbr> Server</a> (use mixed mode authentication and write down the sa password, you will need it later)</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Same for development:
</p>

<ul>
	<li><a rel='external nofollow' href=''>Visual Studio</a></li>
	<li><a rel='external nofollow' href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15'><abbr>SQL</abbr> Server Management Studio</a>*</li>
	<li>A content serialization tool for Sitecore. I‚Äôll use <a rel='external nofollow' href='https://github.com/SitecoreUnicorn/Unicorn'>Unicorn</a>. That‚Äôs just a Nuget package, unlike other alternatives.</li>
</ul>

<p>
	* It is not usual to access the database directly, but some questions about it may arise in the certification exam.
</p>

<p>
	And if you are really committed to learn Sitecore, <a href='https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/'>dotPeek</a> is also your friend.

<h2 id='download'>Find Wally/Waldo installer</h2>

<p>

	Now we need Sitecore binaries.
	When we go to download pages of popular sites we expect things like<br />
	<picture>
		<source srcset='images/downloadthis.avif' type='image/avif' />
		<source srcset='images/downloadthis.webp' type='image/webp' />
		<img src='images/downloadthis.jpg' alt='Download this! obvious sign' />
	</picture>
	or
	<picture>
		<source srcset='images/downloadthis2.avif' type='image/avif' />
		<source srcset='images/downloadthis2.webp' type='image/webp' />
		<img src='images/downloadthis2.jpg' alt='Download this! obvious sign' />
	</picture>
	<br />
	but Sitecore actually makes us go through something like this:<br />
	<picture>
		<source srcset='images/sitecoredownload.avif' type='image/avif' />
		<source srcset='images/sitecoredownload.webp' type='image/webp' />
		<img src='images/sitecoredownload.png' alt='Sitecore inintuitive download' />
	</picture>
</p>

<p>
	Use that mouse scroll and find the link entitled <q>Graphical setup package for XP Single</q>.
</p>

<p>
	At this point I should go into a bit of Sitecore lingo and explain what is <abbr>XP</abbr>, <abbr>XM</abbr> and <abbr>XC</abbr>.
